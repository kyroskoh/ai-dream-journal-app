# AI Dream Journal

This is a multi-modal Dream Journal application that allows users to voice-record their dreams, which are then transcribed, analyzed, and visualized using the power of the Google Gemini API.

## Features

- **Voice-to-Text Transcription**: Record your dream using your voice immediately upon waking. The app uses the Gemini Live API for real-time transcription.
- **AI-Generated Surrealist Art**: Based on the dream's transcription, a unique and surrealist image is generated using the Imagen model to visually represent the core emotional theme.
- **Psychological Interpretation**: Get a structured psychological interpretation of your dream based on Jungian archetypes, generated by the Gemini model.
- **Interactive Dream Chat**: Dive deeper into your dream's meaning. An interactive chat interface allows you to ask follow-up questions about specific symbols, characters, or feelings that appeared in your dream.
- **Persistent Journaling**: Your dreams are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, creating a personal dream archive you can revisit anytime.
- **Tagging and Search**: Organize your dreams by adding custom tags. A powerful search function allows you to instantly find dreams by keywords in the transcription or by your tags.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser with microphone access.
- A Google Gemini API key.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the files).
2.  **API Key Configuration**: This application is designed to run in an environment where the Google Gemini API key is provided as an environment variable `process.env.API_KEY`. Make sure this variable is available in your execution context.
3.  **Run the application**: Serve the `index.html` file using a local web server. All dependencies are loaded via an import map, so no `npm install` is required for the frontend libraries.
