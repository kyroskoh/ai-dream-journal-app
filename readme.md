# AI Dream Journal

This is a multi-modal Dream Journal application that allows users to voice-record their dreams, which are then transcribed, analyzed, and visualized using the power of the Google Gemini API.

## Features

- **Voice-to-Text Transcription**: Record your dream using your voice immediately upon waking. The app uses the Gemini Live API for real-time transcription.
- **AI-Generated Surrealist Art**: Based on the dream's transcription, a unique and surrealist image is generated using the Imagen model to visually represent the core emotional theme.
- **Psychological Interpretation**: Get a structured psychological interpretation of your dream based on Jungian archetypes, generated by the Gemini model.
- **Interactive Dream Chat**: Dive deeper into your dream's meaning. An interactive chat interface allows you to ask follow-up questions about specific symbols, characters, or feelings that appeared in your dream.
- **Persistent Journaling**: Your dreams are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, creating a personal dream archive you can revisit anytime.
- **Tagging and Search**: Organize your dreams by adding custom tags. A powerful search function allows you to instantly find dreams by keywords in the transcription or by your tags.
- **Multilingual Support**: Record, analyze, and discuss your dreams in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser with microphone access (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A Google Gemini API key.

### Setup

1.  **Download the project files.**
2.  **API Key Configuration**: This application is designed to run in an environment where the Google Gemini API key is provided as an environment variable `process.env.API_KEY`. Make sure this variable is available in your execution context.
3.  **Run the application**: Since this is a simple client-side application with no build step, you can serve the `index.html` file using a local web server. One of the easiest ways is to use Python's built-in server:
    ```bash
    # If you have Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## How to Use

1.  **Select Language**: Use the globe icon to select the language you will be speaking in.
2.  **Record Dream**: Click the "Record" button on the main screen to start capturing your dream.
3.  **Speak Freely**: Describe your dream in as much detail as you can.
4.  **Stop Recording**: Click the "Stop" button when you are finished.
5.  **AI Analysis**: Wait a few moments as the AI transcribes your voice, generates a visual representation, and provides a psychological interpretation.
6.  **Explore**: Once processed, you can view the dream's artwork, read the transcription and analysis, and add descriptive tags.
7.  **Chat**: Use the chat panel to ask follow-up questions about your dream for deeper insights.
8.  **Return to Journal**: Click "Return to Journal" to go back to your dream archive, where you can search and revisit all your saved entries.
